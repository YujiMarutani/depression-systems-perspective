# Beyond the Serotonin Hypothesis  
## A Systems-Level Perspective on Depression via Gut–Brain and HPA Axis Dysregulation

This repository accompanies the following preprint:

**Marutani, Y. (2026).**  
*Beyond the serotonin hypothesis: A systems-level perspective on depression via the gut–brain and HPA axis dysregulation* (Version 1.0) [Preprint].  
Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18441046

## Overview

This repository serves as a **companion resource** to the Zenodo preprint listed above.  
The paper proposes a **systems-level conceptual framework for depression**, integrating findings from:

- Psychiatry  
- Neuroimmunology  
- Endocrinology  
- Gut microbiome research  

The central thesis is that depression is better understood as a disorder of **chronic stress regulation**, involving dysregulation of the **gut–brain axis** and the **hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis**, rather than as a primary deficiency of serotonin.

Importantly, this work **does not reject serotonergic mechanisms**, but repositions them as **downstream modulatory processes** within a broader neuroimmune–endocrine system.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository is intended to:

- Provide a stable reference point for the Zenodo preprint  
- Host supplementary conceptual materials (figures, notes, clarifications)  
- Track future revisions (v2.0, v3.0) in a transparent manner  
- Facilitate academic discussion without altering the archival Zenodo record  

The **authoritative version of the paper is the Zenodo DOI-linked preprint**.  
Materials here should be regarded as supplementary.

## Scope and Limitations

This work is a **conceptual synthesis / perspective** paper.

- It does **not** present new experimental data  
- It does **not** claim a definitive causal model  
- It does **not** provide clinical or medical advice  

The goal is to support integrative thinking and further empirical research in **systems psychiatry**.
